## Welcome!

::: {.important style="float: left; width: 65%;"}
**Goals:**

-   Discuss reproducible workflows

-   Implement a reproducible workflow with Git/GitHub

## Let me get to know you!

Please head to this online poll:

- <a href = "https://app.wooclap.com/IOQROK?from=event-page" target = "_blank">https://app.wooclap.com/IOQROK?from=event-page</a>

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/QR.png")
```

- In the downtime, say hello to the people next to you!


## Analysis/Data Science Workflow

Often

-   Read in/connect to raw data set
-   Manipulate/Combine data
-   Summarize to glean insights
-   Apply common analysis methods
-   Communicate Effectively

## Big Issues

Pushed by [psychology](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/behavioral-lab/conduct-research/pre-registration-information), journals are requiring [preregistration](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg), data for submissions, and code to be available in order to reproduce studies

- We have a responsibility to help create literate, critical, ethical thinkers in this world of big data

> Want to document this process and make it reproducible, collaborative, and easily shared!

> Ideally, we immerse students in *modern* data practices

## A Bit About Me

-   Teaching Professor in Department of Statistics at NC State (old picture of me when I was young)
-   Love mixing computing and statistics

Two kids!

## Cooking

Louisa loves to 'cook'

:::

## Delicious Meal!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/food_good.jpg")
```

Delicious! She did it!


## Including Thoughts/Comments

Lousia has trouble remembering what she was thinking when trying her recipes! 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Louisa_work.jpg")
```


## Fatherly Advice: Quarto

If only she'd use Quarto (or perhaps Jupyter) Notebooks!


## Fatherly Advice: Quarto

If only she'd use Quarto (or perhaps Jupyter) Notebooks!

::: {.important style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
-   Give us a way to include thoughts and comments with nice formatting
- Can output to HTML, PDF, Word, Power Point, ...
- Code can be included and output automatically embedded!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/quarto.png")
```
:::

## Quarto

Designed to be used in three ways ([R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto))

-   Communicating to decision makers (focus on conclusions not code)

-   Collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!)

-   As environment to do data science (documents what you did and what you were thinking)


## Take-Away

Have students document their thought processes and work along the way!

- Supply narratives to EDA

    - Why do we care about this awesome graph/stat you've found?

- Never give a graph/result/etc. without discussing it!

Some example projects: <a href = "https://go.ncsu.edu/reproducible_workflows" target ="_blank">https://go.ncsu.edu/reproducible_workflows</a>


## Can't Make the Delicious Meal Again!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bad_food.jpg")
```

She changed some things in the recipe and now can't get it right!

- Oh no! Lack of reproducibility!


## Fatherly Advice: Git/GitHub

If she'd just used Git/GitHub to track her past recipes, we wouldn't be in this mess!

::: {.important style="float: left; width: 45%;"}
-   Git: keeps all recipe versions without this -->

## Git: Version Control Software

- Install git and then you associate it with a folder (repo)

    -   Git keeps track of all files in the folder (repo)
    -   If you want to keep changes you've made, you **commit** the changes
    
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_tracking.png")
```


## Git & GitHub

-   **Git** is a version control software

-   **Github** is an online hosting service for Git-based projects

    -   Very useful for collaborating and sharing work!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github.png")
```


## Basic Git Workflow (Individual)

1. (Initially) **clone** the repo locally.  (Later) **pull** to get most recent versions of files

2. Work and make changes

3. **add** and **commit** to changes you like

4. **push** changes to remote repo (on github)


## Take Away

Version control software simplifies your life!

- Widely used in industry

More Technical vs Less Technical Courses

- Installing Git & `R`/`RStudio`/`Anaconda` may or may not be feasible

- Can use web-based programming environments like <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/" target = "_blank">Google Colab</a> with a `.ipynb` file

- Note: GitHub can be used without installing anything!


## Mixing Cuisines!

Issue: Louisa keeps getting her Chinese food recipes mixed up with her Italian recipes!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Louisa_work_2.jpg")
```


## Fatherly Advice: R Projects

If only she'd use R projects!

::: {.important style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/R_project.png")
```
:::

## R Projects

- Basically a file that gets associated with a folder (repo)

- Maintains a working directory, history, environment, etc.

- Easy to switch between projects without losing work/needing to rerun code

- Combines flawlessly with github!

## Take Away

R projects provide a straightforward way to divide your work into multiple contexts

- Usually associated with a folder
- R projects can be created from github repos!
- Spyder IDE for python has similar functionality


## Sharing Recipes

Louisa wants to share & collaborate with her friends! 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Louisa_Cora.jpg")
```

## Fatherly Advice: Use Quarto/R Projects/Github

If only she'd used an **R project** with **Quarto documents** while being linked to **GitHub**!


## Collaboration with Git & GitHub

- Everyone can work on the same `branch` and just take turns working

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_diagram.png")
```


## Working on Branches

- Alternatively, you can have separate **branches** of the repo

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_branch_diagram.png")
```

- Work on a branch is similar to working on the main branch

- Can **merge** branches when happy!


## Take Away

Version control software that allows for collaboration and working on separate versions of code is an industry standard!

- Git has a steep learning curve but the basics can be done with the web platform


## List of Tools

- Quarto: Integrate text and code to create useful output docs
- R Project: Keep analysis in its own context
- Git: Version control software
- GitHub: Online platform for using git/collaborating
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - web based way to program in python and R 


## Communicating!

- Quarto can be used to create websites on GitHub!

    + <https://jbpost2.github.io/ST-558-Data-Science-for-Statisticians/>
    + <https://jbpost2.github.io/ST-554-Big-Data-with-Python/>


## The AI Thing...

- New sites the run code with AI

    + https://rtutor.ai/ 

    + Chicken data questions: 
    
        - Do the weights differ by diet?
        - How do we take into account time?
        - Can we create a spaghetti plot of chick weights by diet over time?
        - Can we add lines for the mean of each diet group?
  
    + Can grab a markdown report!

## Recap

Reproducibility means:

- Entire analysis can be redone from start to finish

    - Git enables us to do version control
    - GitHub enables us to collaborate and share

- Code should be documented with thought process

    - Quarto or Jupyter Notebooks allow for interweaving of text and code
    
- R projects are great for separating analyses
